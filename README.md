# april-node-quickstart

personal quickstart for node projects

# getting started

- `./project` has the actual node project.
  - note that `.` also has a minimal node project to enforce some standards
- various todo tasks are marked in the project with `!todo:{name}`
  - search '!todo' across the project to see all
  - there are unlabelled `!todo`s as well
  - `!todo:projectName` can be substituted with the name of the project (it's expected this will be consistent across
    github/package.json).
  - `!todo:githubUser`: github username
